Build a Web App to Search Italian Medical Facilities
🩺 Project Title:
FindMyCure Italia – A Search Platform for the Best Medical Facilities in Italy

🧠 What I Want You to Build:
Please help me build a web app that lets users search and compare all types of medical facilities in Italy (hospitals, clinics, specialized centers, etc.) by:

Treatment type / medical specialty

Cost

Quality / performance

This is the beta version. I want to:

Populate a database using real open data

Let users search and filter based on treatment type, location, cost, and quality

Show results with facility name, address, type, cost, quality rating

Include a simple user interface (HTML/CSS/JS or React if preferred)

Use Flask (Python) as backend (or Node.js if you're more comfortable)

📊 What the Database Should Contain:
Facility name (e.g., Ospedale San Raffaele)

Address (street, city)

Region

Type of structure (e.g., hospital, clinic, diagnostic lab)

Specialties / services offered

Cost (approximate if available)

Quality score (based on official indicators or patient reviews)

🌐 USE THESE REAL DATA SOURCES to populate the database:
🏥 Regional Open Datasets (CSV/XML)
Use at least these three to start populating facilities:

Regione Puglia – Anagrafe strutture sanitarie
👉 https://www.dati.puglia.it/dataset/anagrafe-strutture-sanitarie

Provincia Autonoma di Trento – Strutture sanitarie
👉 https://dati.trentino.it/dataset/strutture-sanitarie-pubbliche-e-accreditate

Regione Toscana – Strutture ospedaliere
👉 https://www.opendata.toscana.it/dataset/strutture-ospedaliere

✅ These are open data under IODL 2.0 / CC-BY — you can use and display them with attribution.

📈 Quality Metrics (OPTIONAL for beta)
You can reference:

Programma Nazionale Esiti (PNE) by AGENAS for hospital performance
👉 https://pne.agenas.it/

If you don’t have a direct API, show a placeholder for quality in the database for now.

🧰 Tech Stack
Backend: Python + Flask

Frontend: HTML + Bootstrap (or React if you want)

Database: SQLite (for simplicity), use SQLAlchemy ORM

Scraping or CSV ingestion: Use pandas to load datasets from CSV URLs

🗂 Features
Data Loader

Load and clean datasets from the links above

Normalize fields: facility name, address, type, region, specialty

Database Builder

Store facility info in SQLite

Include cost (if any), quality (placeholder for now), and services offered

User Interface

Simple homepage with search filters: specialty, region, max cost, min quality

Display a list of results with:

Facility name

Address

Type

Quality score

Cost estimate

Search Functionality

Filter by: specialty, region, cost range, quality score

Show results in a clean table or card view

⚖️ Important Notes
Do not scrape restricted sites. Use only open datasets (linked above).

All listed sources are either open data or government portals.

Feel free to enhance the frontend later (optional map, etc.)

✅ First Steps You Should Do
Use pandas to load data from Regione Puglia CSV (from URL)

Normalize and insert into SQLite using SQLAlchemy

Create a /search route in Flask that queries by specialty, cost, quality

Show results in an HTML template

🔄 Later Features (After Beta)
Add Google Maps or OpenStreetMap to show facility locations

Add user review functionality

Add sorting (best-rated, lowest-cost)

Add real-time cost or booking info from APIs (e.g., MioDottore or iDoctors, if partnerships are possible)
