Methodology of Rating
To ensure nationwide performance comparisons, the ratings integrate multiple data sources and criteria:
International Rankings: Used results from Newsweek’s "World’s Best Specialized Hospitals" 2024/2025 (Statista survey) to identify Italian hospitals with top global rankings in each specialty.
National Performance (Agenas PNE): Considered Italy’s Programma Nazionale Esiti 2024 which evaluates outcomes across clinical areas. Notably, only 3 hospitals (IRCCS Humanitas Rozzano, Ospedali Riuniti Marche in Ancona, and Careggi in Florence) achieved high quality in all or nearly all areas, indicating exceptional all-round performance.
Research & Reputation: Gave higher ratings to IRCCS and university hospitals known for research output and specialist training. Clinical reputation (e.g. transplant programs, cancer centers) and strong affiliations (like Catholic University for Gemelli) boosted scores.
Patient Outcomes & Reviews: Where available, factored in patient survival/outcome data and online patient satisfaction. However, formal rankings and outcomes data were weighted more heavily than anecdotal reviews for objectivity.
Key Specialty Highlights (Top Performers in Italy)
Cardiologia (Cardiology): Milan’s Centro Cardiologico Monzino (not in the provided list) is ranked 11th worldwide, and Ospedale San Raffaele (Milano) 12th, making them the national leaders. Other high performers include Policlinico Sant’Orsola-Malpighi (Bologna) and Policlinico Gemelli (Roma) for their renowned cardiac departments. Hospitals in major cities with cardiac surgery and catheterization labs generally scored 4, whereas smaller provincial hospitals without advanced cardiology services scored lower.
Ortopedia (Orthopedics): The Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli (Bologna) is a world-class orthopedics center (9th globally), specializing in complex bone tumors and prosthetic implants. Milan’s Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi is also internationally recognized (top 50 worldwide). These specialty institutes received 5s. Large general hospitals with orthopedic surgery (Niguarda, CTO Torino, etc.) scored 4, while smaller hospitals handling only routine orthopedic cases scored 2–3.
Oncologia (Oncology): Milan leads with the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia (IEO) and Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT) both in the world top 10. The list includes INT Milano (rated 5) and IRCCS oncologic centers in other regions (e.g. INT Bari) which also score highly. Policlinico Gemelli (Roma) is 11th worldwide and tops in central-southern Italy. Major university hospitals (Sant’Orsola, Careggi, San Matteo Pavia) with comprehensive cancer centers score 4. Smaller provincial hospitals that lack extensive oncology departments scored 1–2, reflecting limited cancer treatment services.
Neurologia (Neurology/Neurosurgery): The Carlo Besta Institute (Milan) is Italy’s top neurosciences hospital (17th globally in neurosurgery) followed by Ospedale Niguarda (Milan). Niguarda’s neuro department and IRCCS Neuromed (Pozzilli) are rated 5 for their national prominence in stroke and neurosurgery. Other large hubs (San Raffaele, Gemelli, Molinette Torino) score 4 with advanced neurology clinics. General regional hospitals without specialized neuro units were assigned 2, as complex neurology cases are usually referred to bigger centers.
Urologia (Urology): The University Hospital of Padova is Italy’s top urology center (34th worldwide), narrowly ahead of Ospedale San Raffaele (Milano, 45th worldwide). These and a few others (Gemelli, Careggi) earned 5 for high-volume robotic surgery and transplant programs. Most tertiary hospitals with urology departments (e.g. Niguarda, Molinette, Federico II Napoli) scored 4. Hospitals without dedicated urology (or only basic urology) were marked 2, as they handle fewer complex urologic surgeries.
Chirurgia generale (General Surgery): Multi-specialty research hospitals like Humanitas Research Hospital (Rozzano) and Policlinico Gemelli (Roma) excel across surgical disciplines, reflected in top scores. In fact, Humanitas was rated the #1 hospital in Italy for overall performance for 3 years running. Other academic centers (Sant’Orsola Bologna, Careggi Firenze, Policlinico San Martino Genova, Niguarda Milano) also received 4–5 in surgery due to transplant units and high surgical volumes. Mid-sized provincial hospitals performing routine surgeries are mostly rated 3. Very small hospitals (e.g. in remote areas) scored 1–2, as complex surgeries are referred out.
Pediatria (Pediatrics): Rome’s Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù (6th worldwide) and Istituto Gaslini (Genova, 7th worldwide) are Europe-leading children’s hospitals – both rated 5. Florence’s Meyer and Naples’ Santobono are top pediatric centers in their regions (scores 4). General hospitals typically have pediatrics units but not of national prominence, so most received 3. Hospitals without a pediatric ward or only basic care for children were given 1–2.
Ginecologia (Gynecology & Obstetrics): The Policlinico Gemelli in Rome ranks 4th worldwide in obstetrics/gynecology, making it the clear national leader (rating 5). Other major obstetric hospitals like Careggi (Firenze) and Sant’Orsola (Bologna) also scored 5 due to advanced maternal-fetal medicine and cancer surgery. Big regional centers (Umberto I in Roma, Cardarelli in Napoli, etc.) scored 4 with robust women’s health departments. Smaller hospitals without tertiary-level obstetrics/gynecology services are rated 2 or 3.
